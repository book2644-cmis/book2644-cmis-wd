		<h2> List and Links Assignment
		</h2>
		<p2> This is a webpage I created in computer class. The purpose of this assignment is to create list (order, unordered) and links. Below is the instruction I followed.
		<ul>
			<li>Create a new folder called "listsandlinks" in your repository folder.</li>
			<li>Inside listsandlinks create a file called "index.html" and a file called "main.css"</li>
			<li>In index.html create an ordered list of step by step instructions to create a new webpage on the production server.</li>
			<li>Also create an unordered list of 5 or more links to websites with useful webdesign related information.</li>
			<li>In the nav section, create an unordered list of links with a link back to your main index page.</li>
			<li>In your main index.html file in public_html, add an unordered list of links to the nav section with a link to "listsandlinks".</li>
			<li>In your old index.html, add an article with a heading and a paragraph description of this assignment.</li>
			<li> Also add an unordered list that contains this list of requirements.</li> 
			<li>Turn in your work.</li> 
		</ul>
